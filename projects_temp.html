            my ML projects are my creative pride and joy. they are the most practical applications of my knowledge and explore the ways in which i can use my programming knowledge to make an impact in the real world and my own life. these are the most prominent reflections of my curiosity, creative nature, and interest in applying my knowledge to real-world disciplines such as finance and medicine

            while ML ml projects take the creative cake, so to speak, my Java projects were some of my largest. these were all done in my 200/300 level dual enrollment courses and required some of the most handtracing, collaboration, and problem-solving of my projects. they all cover advanced data structures such as linked lists, binary trees, and hashsets.

            the games i’ve developed have all served as manifestations of my creative ideas. whenever i’ve played a video game that lacked a particular feature or thought of a really interesting concept, developing games has always been my way of expressing these creative and entertaining ideas
